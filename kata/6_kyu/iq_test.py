# IQ Test
# By: AlexIsHappy

# Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in
# this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs
# from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs
# from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers,
# he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that
# is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.
# ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test,
# which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)
